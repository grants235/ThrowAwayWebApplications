# Entity Framework Throw-Away Project on ASP.NET
## About the Project
This is a projct that was made for the purpose to learn about how to use Entity Framework on an ASP.NET Core MVC application in order to more easily interface with an SQL database. You can find the tutorial that I used to make this project on here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application

## What Does it Do
This is a mock database for a school to keep records for students first name, last name, enrollment date, and what courses they are enrolled in. You can go in and create/edit/delete users and couses. At the moment, you cannot add/remove students from courses but I plan to add that feature soon.

## Purpose
I made that project to learn how to use the Entity Framework with an ASP.NET Core MVC application. I need it for my larger application for the login process and to store critical data. I will also be adding more throw-away projects that will all be for the sole purpose of learning how to implement the technologies and ad all of them to a more featureful project that you can find here: https://github.com/grants235/Security-PS-Internship-Application
