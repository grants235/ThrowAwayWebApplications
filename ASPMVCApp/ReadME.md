# Entity Framework Throw-Away Project on ASP.NET
## About the Project
This is a projct that was made for the purpose to learn about how to use Entity Framework on an ASP.NET Core MVC application in order to more easily interface with an SQL database. You can find the tutorial that I used to make this project on here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application

## What Does It Do
This project is a mock movie website where you can go and add movie "listings" and that gets added to the back-end SQL database. You can edit and delete the existing "listing" to show how to edit the back-end database. 

## Purpose
I made that project to learn how to use the Entity Framework with an ASP.NET Core MVC application. I need it for my larger application for the login process and to store critical data. I will also be adding more throw-away projects that will all be for the sole purpose of learning how to implement the technologies and ad all of them to a more featureful project that you can find here: https://github.com/grants235/Security-PS-Internship-Application
